### 1. **Why did it work locally when you specified the webserver port `8080` as a string?**

#### Explanation:
In your local environment, the system you were running likely treated the string representation of the port (`"8080"`) correctly by coercing it into an integer internally. This behavior is common in many programming environments or libraries that handle SFTP/SSH configurations because:

- Ports are inherently numeric, so libraries often attempt to convert string-based ports (like `"8080"`) to integers for socket communication.
- Your local system or library used for SFTP may have a fallback mechanism to handle strings gracefully by internally converting `"8080"` to `8080`.

#### Why this worked:
1. **Local environment leniency:** Your local environment might not have strict restrictions, allowing the port to be interpreted flexibly.
2. **Library behavior:** Many libraries internally cast string inputs to integers where ports are involved.

This is not guaranteed behavior and can vary based on the SFTP client or library you're using.

### 2. **Why didn’t it work in the VM when running the project with port `8080` as a string?**

#### Explanation:
The failure in the VM could be due to multiple factors:

1. **Port restriction or redirection on the VM:**
   - Many hosted VMs enforce specific rules through firewalls or network configurations. Port `8080` might be restricted or redirected to another service (e.g., Tomcat).
   - The VM may not allow traffic on `8080` unless explicitly configured, whereas port `22` (default SSH/SFTP port) is typically open for SFTP/SSH.

2. **String interpretation issue:**
   - Unlike your local setup, the SFTP library or client in the VM environment might **not** handle string-to-integer coercion properly.
   - If the port remains as a string (`"8080"`), the system might fail to establish a connection because it expects a numeric port.

3. **Conflict with Tomcat configuration:**
   - You mentioned that the previous DevOps team configured a Tomcat web server on port `8080`. If this configuration was not removed or updated properly, the VM might still have port `8080` tied to the web server rather than the SFTP service. As a result:
     - SFTP traffic to `8080` would either be blocked or misrouted.

### 3. **Should server configurations (ports) in environment variables be integers or strings?**

#### Proper Practice:
Environment variables are always **stored as strings** because they are generally treated as text. However, it depends on how the consuming application handles the variables. 

- **For ports specifically:**
  - Use integers where possible in your code or configuration, as ports are inherently numeric. 
  - If you're storing them in environment variables (which are strings by default), ensure the application explicitly converts them to integers during usage.

#### Common approach:
1. Define the port as a string in the `.env` file or environment:
   ```env
   SFTP_PORT=22
   ```
2. Convert it to an integer in your code:
   ```python
   SFTP_PORT = int(os.getenv('SFTP_PORT', 22))  # Default to 22 if not set
   ```

#### Why this matters:
- By explicitly converting strings to integers in your code, you eliminate any ambiguity or library-specific behavior.
- It ensures compatibility across different environments and avoids bugs like the one in your VM setup.

### 4. **What is the proper way to define values like ports, connections, third-party API details, or secrets in environment variables?**

#### Best Practices for Defining Environment Variables:

1. **General Rules:**
   - Always store environment variables as strings (default behavior).
   - Explicitly parse and convert them in your application as needed.

2. **Ports:**
   - Define them as integers in your code but store them as strings in environment variables:
     ```env
     SFTP_PORT=22
     ```
   - Convert to integer when using:
     ```python
     port = int(os.getenv('SFTP_PORT', 22))
     ```

3. **Third-party API credentials:**
   - Store them as strings:
     ```env
     API_KEY="your_api_key_here"
     ```
   - Avoid adding special characters unless necessary (to avoid parsing issues).

4. **Secrets (Passwords, Tokens):**
   - Use secure storage mechanisms like AWS Secrets Manager, Vault, or Azure Key Vault where possible.
   - If stored in environment variables:
     ```env
     SECRET_KEY="your_secret_key_here"
     ```

5. **Booleans or flags:**
   - Represent them as strings (`"true"`, `"false"`) and parse explicitly:
     ```python
     DEBUG_MODE = os.getenv('DEBUG', 'false').lower() == 'true'
     ```

6. **Database configurations:**
   - Store sensitive details (e.g., passwords) securely:
     ```env
     DB_USER="username"
     DB_PASSWORD="password"
     DB_PORT=5432
     ```

### 5. **Additional Clarifications on Your Colleague’s Statement:**

#### "VM can’t access web port `8080` directly due to restrictions":
This is likely correct. Hosted VMs often have strict firewall rules or NAT configurations:

- Port `8080` might be blocked for external access unless explicitly opened.
- Even if the VM itself allows `8080` internally, it could require explicit configuration for external access.
- Using port `22` worked because it’s a standard port for SSH/SFTP and is often open by default.

---

### Summary of Key Points:

1. **Why it worked locally:**
   - Your local setup or library gracefully handled the string-to-integer conversion for port `8080`.

2. **Why it failed in the VM:**
   - Port `8080` might be restricted by firewalls or still associated with Tomcat. Additionally, string coercion might not have occurred in the VM environment.

3. **Integer vs. String for Environment Variables:**
   - Ports should be stored as strings in `.env` but explicitly converted to integers in the application.

4. **Proper way to define environment variables:**
   - Use strings for storage, convert and validate explicitly in code.
   - Securely store secrets and sensitive data.

5. **Colleague’s claim on port `8080`:**
   - Likely accurate, as hosted VMs often block non-standard ports by default. Port `22` worked because it is commonly open for SFTP/SSH.
